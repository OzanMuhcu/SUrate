# SUrate

A mobile application for Sabancı University students to rate and review courses and instructors.

## The Problem

At Sabancı University, students often rely on friends or scattered WhatsApp groups to get information about course content, difficulty level, assignments, exams, and instructors. This information is often fragmented, inconsistent, and not easily accessible for every course or instructor, making it difficult for students to make informed decisions about their course selections.

## Our Solution

**SUrate** provides a centralized, dedicated platform for Sabancı students to solve this problem. It is a mobile application where students can register using their official university email accounts. Once registered, students who have taken or are currently taking a course can rate and leave detailed comments about both the course and its instructor.

This creates a reliable, peer-reviewed database of course information, accessible to the entire student community.

## Features

-   **Secure Authentication:** Students register and log in using their Sabancı University email accounts.
-   **Course Reviews:** Rate courses based on content, difficulty, workload, and grading.
-   **Instructor Feedback:** Rate instructors on their teaching style, clarity, and helpfulness.
-   **Written Comments:** Leave detailed, anonymous comments to share specific insights and advice.
-   **Centralized Database:** A single, easy-to-search source for all course and instructor information.
